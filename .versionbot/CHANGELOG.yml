    - subject: Fix table not displaying data when data length reduces
      hash: fc9bbcb80731230bde33459c16bdc1fa512cd174
      body: |
        If the data length becomes less than the initial one
        (like when you apply a filter), the data would not show
        up, and the pager will get stuck at whatever page the user
        was at.
